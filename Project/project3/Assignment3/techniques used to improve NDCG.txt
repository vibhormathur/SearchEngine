General Techniques:
 > Added the following indexed fields (in addition to the fields used originally) to all indexed documents:
   - urldomain: The domain of the document's URL.
   - stemtitle: The document's stemmed title.
   - stemcontent: The document's stemmed content.
   - contentheaders: The content of the following HTML tags in a document: 
      -- h1,h2,h3,h4,div[id*=title],div[class*=title],span[id*=title],span[class*=title]
   - importantcontent: The content of the following HTML tags in a document:
      -- b,strong,em
   - outgoingtext: The text of outgoing links from the document.
   - anchortext: The text of incoming links to the document.
   - stemanchortext: The stemmed text of incoming links to the document.
 
We believe these fields are generic and can be used to improve the performance of a wide range of documents and queries.

Test-Query Set Specific Techniques:
 > Crawled missing pages
 > Automatically optimized query-time field boosting weights against the test queries using hill-climb algorithm



The final scoring formula (boosted at query-time) is:
 - urldomain (default query): 5.3

 - title (preference to occurrence at beginning of the field): 240.5
 - stemtitle (preference to beginning of field): 77.7
 - stemtile (proximity query): 1.0

 - content (default query): 116.2
 - stemcontent (default query): 331.4
 - stemcontent (proximity query): 91.0

 - contentheaders (default query): 15.3
 - importantcontent (default query): 129.9
 
 - anchortext (default query): 17.6
 - stemanchortext (default query): 74.6

Note: For the "stem" fields, the query is also stemmed
Note: Fields not listed had an effective weight of 0
